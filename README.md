## Game Description and Features

The game is a simple and fun browser-based game that is both mobile and desktop friendly. The game features a visually appealing design with a game container, buttons, and text styled using CSS.

## How to Play

2. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
3. Press any key to interact with the game.

## Running the Game Locally

To run the game locally using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The game should load and be ready to play.

Alternatively, you can use a local server to serve the files. For example, you can use the `http-server` package from npm:

1. Install `http-server` globally using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game files:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/repository
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   http-server
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to the address provided by `http-server` (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

Enjoy playing the game!
